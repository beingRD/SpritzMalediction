Spritz Malediction by Namaste Group. A playground project made with love in Naples!

# Storyboard

Once upon a time, there were three guys from Apple Developer Academy. They were chilling around Naples on a Friday night in Piazza San Domenico. While talking and laughing, they met an old, poor and ugly woman, full of **Curniciello “Lucky Charm”** all over her body. She wanted to sell them, but the guys refused, so she cursed them with her curniciello, saying they would have died if they had not taken a spritz.

So they started looking for a spritz to survive the curse, but suddenly they were robbed by bad guys on a scooter without a helmet. The bad guy said, “we uajo’ bell stu orologio” (Yo, your watch is nice) and stole all their money, **they were barely left with 3 euros**.

Hence, the **game of survival** starts!!

And they start hunting for a place where they can find a **Spritz for 1 euro each**. Screams!!
